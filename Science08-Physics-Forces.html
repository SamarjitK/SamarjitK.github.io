        <center><h1>Density</h1></center>
        <p>Density is the amount of matter in a fixed volume, or how tightly the particles are packed.</p>
        <p>It is measured as mass divided by volume. It is usually g/cm<sup>2</sup> or kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
        <p>Water has a density of 1g/cm<sup>2</sup>. Anything with less than that amount of density will float on water, anything more will sink.</p>
        <p>When you say, for example, 237kg/m<sup>2</sup>, you are saying,'in any m<sup>2</sup> of this material, the average weight is 237kg.' That is, how dense it is.</p>
        <p>Water's density can also be measured as 1000kg/m<sup>2</sup>, as the SI unit of density is kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
        <p>g/cm<sup>2</sup> is known as relative density, or the ratio of the material's density to water's density.</p>
        <p>So, D(density)= m(mass)/v(volume), or M=DV, or V=M/D</p>
        <center><h1>Pressure</h1></center>
        <p>The amount of force on a certain area is called pressure. The SI unit is Pascal(Pa), which is equal to Newton/Meter<sup>2</sup>.</p>
        <p>Pressure is Force/Area. For example, a knife has a lot of force pressing on a small area, so it has high pressure. A camel's foot is a good example for low pressure.</p>
        <p>Let's say that the camel's hoof has an area of .25m<sup>2</sup>. It's a baby camel, so it has a force of 5 Newtons. Pa = 5N/.25m<sup>2</sup>*4(feet), which simplifies to 5N/m<sup>2</sup>, or 5 Pa.</p>
        <center><h1>Pressure in gases and liquids</h1></center>
        <p>Lets say that you fill a tank with water or air. Each of the particles have space to move around, and they are constantly hitting each other, and the container.</p>
        <p>All the hits add up, creating pressure on the tank. Thats why when you pump up a balloon, the particles have more collisions with the balloon, until it finally pops.</p>
        <p>In water pressure or atmospheric pressure, the pressure of the ocean or atmosphere respectively pushes on you. The pressure of a gas or liquid is caused by its waight pressing downwards.</p>
        <center><h1>Moments</h1></center>
        <p>When you have something on a pivot, like a doorknob or weighing scale, it can have a turning effect, maiking it turn clockwise or anticlockwise.</p>
        <p>Take a seesaw, for example. If you have an adult sitting on the left side, he will have an anti-clockwise turning effect(he will push the seesaw anticlockwise).</p>
        <p>When a small boy sits on the right side, he will have a clockwise turning effect, but he does not have enough force(weight) to counteract the anticlockwise turning effect.</p>
        <p>But the principle of moments states that the turning effect of an object, also known as the moment of the force, is found by the force multiplied by its distance from the pivot.</p>
        <p>So, to balance the moments, the boy must move further from the pivot, and the adult should go closer.</p>
        <p>So, moment = force * distance from pivot, or moment(Nm) = Newtons(N) * Meters(m)</p>
