        <center><h1>Reaction of Metal with water</h1></center>
        <p>Alkali metals react quickly with water to form a metal hydroxide.</p>
        <p>metal + water -> metal hydroxide + hydrogen^ (liberated/released)</p>
        <p>Other metals, however, do not react so easily. So, they are reacted with steam, a gaseous form of water that has enough heat to react the metal. For example:</p>
        <p>Aluminium + Water -> Aluminium Oxide + Hydrogen^</p>
        <p>These non-alkali metals react to form a metal oxide, not metal hydroxide (alkali)</p>
        <center><h1>Reaction of Metal and Acid</h1></center>
        <p>A metal reacts with an acid to form a salt and liberate hydrogen. You will learn about salts in the next lesson.</p>
        <p>magnesium + hydrochloric acid -> magnesium chloride (salt) + hydrogen^</p>
        <center><h1>Salts</h1></center>
        <p>You have now learnt that a salt is formed from the reaction of a metal and acid. Acids have a replacable hydrogen ion.</p>
        <p>The name of the salt depends on the metal and tha acid used (eg Salts made with ______ and HCl are called _____ chloride).</p>
        <p>A salt is formed when hydrogen in an acid is replaced by a metal or ammonium. Examples:</p>
        <table>
          <tr><th>Salt              </th><th>Use                   </th><th>Formula</th></tr>
          <tr><td>Calcium Sulfate</td><td>Chalkpiece</td><td>CaSO<sub>4</sub></td></tr>
          <tr><td>Aluminium Sulfate</td><td>Dyes (to stick fibers)</td><td>AlSO<sub>4</sub></td></tr>
          <tr><td>Copper Sulfate</td><td>Stop fungi growth</td><td>CuSO<sub>4</sub></td></tr>
          <tr><td>Sodium Chloride</td><td>Table Salt</td><td>NaCl</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Magnesium Carbonate</td><td>Sports(to keep hands dry)</td><td>MgCO<sub>3</sub></td></tr>
          <tr><td>Ammonium Nitrate</td><td>Fertilizer Content</td><td>NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub></td></tr>
        </table>
        <p>Sometimes, a metal is not reactive with acid, so metal oxide is used:</p>
        <p>metal oxide + acid -> salt + water</p>
        <p>One type of salt made from carbonic acid - carbonate - can be reacted again with acid:</p>
        <p>acid + metal carbonate -> salt (metal with acid) + carbon dioxide (from the carbonate) + water</p>
        <center><h1>Neutralization</h1></center>
        <p>Another way of making a salt is through a neutralization reaction</p>
        <p>Remember that a metal oxide is a base, and a soluble base can be dissolved in water to form an alkali, which is a metal hydroxide.</p>
        <p>Neutralization is so called ecause the acid and alkali have opposite pH, so are neutralized when the react together:</p>
        <p>acid + alkali -> salt + water | Example: sodium hydroxide + hydrochloric acid -> sodium chloride + water</p>
        <center><h1>The Reactivity Series</h1></center>
        <p>Some metals are more reactive than others, and this is shown in the reactivity series from most to least reactive:</p>
        <table>
          <tr><th>Metal</th><th>Reaction with Oxygen</th><th>Reaction with Water</th><th>Reaction with dilute acid</th></tr>
          <tr><td>Potassium</td><td rowspan = "2">Burns brightly when heated to form an oxide</td><td rowspan = "2">Very vigorous reaction in cold wate to form hydroxide</td><td rowspan ="3">Violent reaction, very dangerous</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Sodium</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Calcium</td><td rowspan = "2">Burns brightly in air when heated to form an oxide</td><td rowspan ="2">Slow reaction in cold water to form the hydroxide</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Magnesium</td><td rowspan = "5">Reaction, becomes less vigorous as you go down</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Aluminium</td><td rowspan = "5">Slow reaction when heated to form an oxide</td><td rowspan = "3">Reacts with steam but not water to form an oxide</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Zinc</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Iron</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Lead</td><td rowspan = "4">No reaction with steam or water</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Copper</td><td rowspan="3">No reaction</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Silver</td><td rowspan = "2">No reaction</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Gold</td></tr>
        </table>
        <center><h1>Displacement Reactions</h1></center>
        <p>If a metal is reacted with a compound in which the metal in the compound is less reactive than the other metal, it can be displaced. For example:</p>
        <p>Copper Sulfate + Iron -> Iron Sulfate + Copper</p>
        <p>Since Iron is more reactive than copper, it displaces(Switches places with) the copper. If you put an iron nail in copper sulfate, it will become iron sulfate and the nail will be coate in copper.</p>
        <p>In railways, a displacement reaction known as thermite reaction is used to extract iron from iron ore: aluminium + iron oxide (iron ore) -> iron + aluminium oxide.</p>
        <p>The reaction gives out tremendous, heat, and results in molten iron, which can be easily welded.</p>
        <p>Though carbon is not a metal, it can displace any metal which is less reactive than aluminium:</p>
        <p>iron oxide + carbon -> iron + carbon dioxide</p>
        <center><h1>Oxidation Reaction</h1></center>
        <p>You know that iron rusts over many years due to reaction with oxygen. But who's going to wait that long?</p>
        <p>Metals, Carbon, and Hydrogen can be heated (therefore react with oxygen) to create metal oxide, carbon dioxide, and water, respectively.</p>
        <p>When you burn something to react it with oxygen,it is called a combustion reaction.</p>
        <p>When any substance combines with oxygen, it is called an oxidation reaction. Combustion is an oxidation reaction</p>
        <center><h1>Exothermic and Endothermic</h1></center>
        <p>An exothermic reaction is a reaction that gives out heat from its chemical energy.</p>
        <p>An endothermic reaction takes in heat from the surroundings and stores it as chemical energy.</p>
        <p>Here are som examples of Endothermic and Exothermic reactions and processes.</p>
        <table>
          <tr><th>Endothermic</th><th>Exothermic</th></tr>
          <tr><td>Freezing water</td><td>Melting ice</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Condensation</td><td>Evaporation</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Salt Dissolving in water</td><td>Oxidation</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Sodium Hydrogencarbonate + Citric Acid -> Sodium Citrate +Water + Carbon Dixide (cool sherbet sweets)</td><td>Metal + Acid</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Ammonium Nitrate + Water (Ice Pack)</td><td>Neutralization Reaction</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Photosynthesis</td><td>Metal or metal oxide + Water</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Breaking Chemical Bonds</td><td>Making Chemical Bonds</td></tr>
