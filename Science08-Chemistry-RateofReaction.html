        <center><h1>Measuring Rate of Reaction</h1></center>
        <p>Rate of the Reaction is how fact the product of a reaction is being made. But how can we measure it?</p>
        <p>In most reactions, some gas is liberated. By channelling all the gas to a syringe, we can see the amount of gases liberated at different times, and therefore plot the rate of reaction.</p>
        <p>You can also measure the speed of loss of reactants, for example, the loss in mass as gas is liberated.</p>
        <p>The steeper the plotted slope, the faster the reaction. In most reactions,the rate slows down, which gives you a hill shaped curve.</p>
        <center><h1>Collision Theory</h1></center>
        <p>Reactions only occur when particles of the reactants collide with each other.</p>
        <p>The more often the collisions, the more chance that the particles will react quickly.</p>
        <p>Collision results in breaking of bonds, forming new bonds that result in the product.</p>
        <p>But to break bonds, a certain amount of energy is needed, and the amount of energy differs from reaction to reaction.</p>
        <p>The minimum amount of energy required to 'jumpstart'or begin the reaction is the Activation Energy.</p>
        <p>This is normally given through heat, like burning pottassium to start the combustion reaction.</p>
        <p>But it can also be in the form of light, like in photosynthesis. If more than the minimum activation energy is provided, the rate of reaction increases.</p>
        <p>In collision theory, this gives each particle more energy, making it more excited and more likely to collide faster.</p>
        <center><h1>Surface Area</h1></center>
        <p>In reactions involving solids, the reaction takes place on its surface. In a large block of magnesium in acid, only the outer most layer can react at a time.</p>
        <p>Collsions take place on the surface of solids. If you use solids in powdered form, maximum particles are exposed, so that the acid particles can collide with more atoms at one time</p>
        <p>Using one or more solids in powdered form or with more surface are exposed greatly increases the rate of reaction.</p>
        <center><h1>Temperature</h1></center>
        <p>We have already discussed about activation energy, and how applying more heat or light makes the rate of reactin more.</p>
        <p>When you increase the temperature, the particles are more excited and the collisions are more frequent</p>
        <p>When you increase the temperature by 10&#8451; or decrease it by 10&#8451;, it will double or halve the rate of reaction, respectively.</p>
        <center><h1>Concentration</h1></center>
        <p>When a solution is more concentrated, there are more particles of reactant in a given volume.</p>
        <p>For example, acid is more concentrated than dilute acid. That means that collisions accur with reactants more often when the reactants are more concentrated.</p>
        <p>So, an increase in the concentration of one or more of the reactants can increases the rate of reaction.</p>
        <center><h1>Using a Catalyst</h1></center>
        <p>Catalysts are substances that increase the rate of reaction but remain chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction, so that they can be used again.</p>
        <p>Some provide a surface for the reaction. Some actually take part in the reaction. Some bring reactants closer and weaken their bonds. But at the end, they are unchanged and undestroyed.</p>
        <p>In our body, we produce protein molecules called enzymes, which are also catalysts. Catalysts are specific, and most reactions have different catalysts.</p>
        <p>They are useful because adding a small amount of catalyst can greatly increase the rate of reaction. Here are some examples:</p>
        <table>
          <tr><th>Industrial Processes</th><th>Catalyst Used</th></tr>
          <tr><td>Making Ammonia</td><td>Iron</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Making Sulfuric Acid</td><td>Vanadium Oxide</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Making Margarine</td><td>Nickel</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Making Nitric Acid</td><td>Platinum-Rhodium</td></tr>
        </table>
        <p>So, adding a catalyst to a reaction mixture can increase the rate of reaction</p>
