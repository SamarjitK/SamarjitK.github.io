        <center><h1>Static Electricity</h1></center>
        <p>When a plastic rod is charged by a cloth and hung on a string, and another rod which has been rubbed is brought near, the two repel.</p>
        <p>When a polythene rod, is rubbed by wool, the polythene rod takes electrons from the wool. When you use an acrylic rod and cotton instead, the opposite is true, and the acrylic rod is positively charged.</p>
        <p>This is because some materials tend to take, and some tend to give, electrons:</p>

        <p>The charge can be measured in Coulombs, and the charge of 1 electron is 1.6*10<sup>-19</sup>Coulombs, measured in a Coulombmeter.</p>
        <p>Acrylic is also an electron donator.</p>
        <center><h1>Conductors and Insulators</h1></center>
        <p>Conductors allow elctricity to flow around the circuit, while insulators stop it:</p>

        <center><h1>Electric Current</h1></center>
        <p>Current is the flow of electrons through a circuit.</p>
        <p>It is measured in SI unit Amp (A), with an ammeter. It flows from the positive end of the cell to the negative end.</p>
        <p>If you have components connected end to end, it is called a series circuit.</p>
        <p>In a series circuit, the current isn't used up when going through any component, such as a lamp.</p>
        <p>Though current is said to travel from + to -, the flow of electrons is actually from - to +.</p>
        <center><h1>Voltage</h1></center>
        <p>Voltage is the force pushing the electrons. The bigger the voltage, the bigger the current. Voltage is measured with a voltmeter.</p>
        <p>If you place batteries correctly back to back, the total voltage is the sum of their voltages.</p>
        <center><h1>Resistance</h1></center>
        <p>Resistance, measured in Ohms, makes the current in a circuit smaller.</p>
        <p>In a series circuit, resistance is greater, and the current lesser, because it becomes harder to push electrons.</p>
        <center><h1>Ohm's Law</h1></center>
        <p>Ohm's law states that Voltage is Current multiplied by Resistance, or V=IR.</p>
        <p>In a parallel circuit, where components are connected side by side, the total resistance is the reciprocal of the sums of the reciprocals of the sum of the resistances in each parallel.</p>
        <p>Confusing right? Let's take R1 and R2 as the sums of the resistance of 2 parallels: Total R = 1/(1/R1+1/R2)</p>
        <p>Additionally, power, measured in Watts, is Voltage into Current.</p>
