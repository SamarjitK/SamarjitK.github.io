        <center><h1>Keys</h1></center>
        <p>A key is a set of questions that you can use to identify an organism.</p>
        <p>The first question set will have an a and b. Here is an example of a key for crab, earthworm, and slug:</p>
        <p>1 a has legs ....................crab</p>
        <p>1 b does not have legs ..........go to 2</p>
        <p>2 a body not made up of rings ...slug</p>
        <p>2 b body made up of rings .......earthworm</p>
        <p>You can make questions based on color, texture, features, numbers, behavior, and many other criteria.</p>
        <center><h1>Variation</h1></center>
        <p>Living organisms are classified into species, though no 2 organisms of a species are exactly alike.</p>
        <p>They show variation, difference among individuals within a species</p>
        <p>This is because of two things: genes and environment.</p>
        <p>You have genes in te nucleus of every cell, which decide things like you gender, and hair color.</p>
        <p>Your environment also affects your variation, like how people who do heavy lifting will have large wrists.</p>
        <center><h1>Inheritance</h1></center>
        <p>In the nucleus of each cell there are chromosomes which give you genes. The are made out of DNA.</p>
        <p>When you are born, you recieve half of each parents genes, which becomes a zygote cell, which was your first cell.</p>
        <p>Genes, which are instructions, come in many different forms.</p>
        <p>One form might give you curly hair, another might make it straight.</p>
        <p>Genes are inherited from your parents, though some things like your behavior might be altered by your environment.</p>
        <center><h1>Selective Breeding</h1></center>
        <p>Lets say you have a population of sheep, and you want to get more wool.</p>
        <p>You would only choose the sheep with longer wool, because you know that they would pass on their genes of long wool to their offspring.</p>
        <p>You would breed these chosen ones together, and the result would be a sheep with longer wool</p>
        <p>This is called selective breeding. If you did this for many generations, you would end up with a population of sheep with only longer wool.</p>
        <center><h1>Natural Selection</h1></center>
        <p>In selective breeding, we humans select the animals with the features we want and allow themm to reproduce.</p>
        <p>This also happens in nature, but is a slower process. We already know there is variation within populations.</p>
        <p>Let's say that there are bears, but some have thicker fur than others. Over time, the climate becomes colder.</p>
        <p>In the colder weather, the bears with thin fur are more likely to die. Similarly, the thick furred bears would have a greater chance of survival.</p>
        <p>The thick furred bears would be the only survivors, and reproduce, and their offspring would inherit the thick fur and also survive.</p>
        <p>This is natural selection, where nature selects the variations best for their survival.</p>
        <p>Charles Darwin was a scientist who laid the foundation for the study of evolution in his book, the origin of species.</p>
        <p>In his book, he proposed the theory natural selection:</p>
        <p>The individuals that are best adapted to their environment are the ones that are most likely to pass on their features to the next generation.</p>
