        <center><h1>Our Energy</h1></center>
        <p>We as humans require a supply of energy to do... anything, actually.</p>
        <p>It is mainly used in three sectors: industry, transport, and in homes and offices.</p>
        <p>In all countries as a whole, more than half of the energy we generate is used by industry.</p>
        <p>As countries become richer, people tend to spend more, and use more energy, for example buying cars which require more fuel.</p>
        <p>In fact, the US uses more energy per person than Europe, South America, Africa, China, and India combined!</p>
        <center><h1>Non-Renewable Sources</h1></center>
        <p>More than three quarters of our energy is from Fossil Fuels, which are stores of chemical energy from underground. They are burnt to release their energy in fossil fuel power stations.</p>
        <p>They are found in three forms- coal, oil, and gas. They are very useful as they are very cncentrated stores of energy.</p>
        <p>When ancient plants died millions of years ago, over time, their fossils were compressed into coal by layers of rocks. Oil and Gas are formed the same way, but from the remains of sea creatures.</p>
        <p>Since these organisms originally got their energy from the sun, when we burn fossil fuels, we are making use of very ancient sunlight.</p>
        <p>A lesser used fuel is called nuclear energy, which is the energy harnessed in a nuclear power station that radioactive elements release when they decay.</p>
        <p>Fossil Fuels and Nuclear energy are known as non-renewable resources. That means that once it is used, it is gone forever, and will take millions of years to be replenished.</p>
        <center><h1>Renewable Resources</h1></center>
        <p>Less than one eighth of our energy comes from renewables, which are cleane and greener because they are not burnt.</p>
        <p>The wind in our atmosphere can spin wind turbines, and this rotational energy can be harnessed by a generator as electricity.</p>
        <p>The force of a river can also turn a mill wheel, and is it is dammed, it can turn turbines-just like in wind energy.</p>
        <p>Using photovoltaic cells, where the atoms become excited due to light, we can harness the power of the sun as electricity.</p>
        <p>Wood and Crops can be harvested and fermented to produce liquid fuel.</p>
        <p>These are all renewable souces of energy, meaning that it is constantly replenished.</p>
        <center><h1>Conduction</h1></center>
        <p>In solids and liquids, energy can spread from a hotter place to a cooler place in a process called conduction.</p>
        <p>The energy is transferred from one vibrating particle to the next.</p>
        <p>Like in electricity, most metals are good thermal conductors, meaning that they conduct the heat faster.</p>
        <p>Most nonmetals are poor thermal conductors, known as thermal insulators.</p>
        <center><h1>Convection</h1></center>
        <p>When energy is transferred in a fluid where the fluid itself moves, it is known as convection.</p>
        <p>Since warmer fluids are less dense, they float up through colder fluid, spreading the heat across the entire fluid.</p>
        <center><h1>Radiation</h1></center>
        <p>When an object is very hot, it not only emits light, but also emits infrared radiation, which is outside the visible spectrum.</p>
        <p>Anything that absorbs this radiation becomes warm. Like light, it can travel through vacuum(empty space) and through transparent materials.</p>
        <p>Like light, black surfaces are good at absorbing it, and shiny or white surfaces are good at reflecting it.</p>
        <p>This process, known as radiation, is how heat from the sun reaches us.</p>
        <center><h1>Evaporation</h1></center>
        <p>Evaporation is not like boiling because the temperature does not have to reach 100 degrees celsius.</p>
        <p>The warmer particles evaporate into water vapor first, leaving the cooler ones. Thus, evaporation decreases the temperature of the water.</p>
        <p>It can cool us down because when it evaporates, it absorbs our heat energy first, so we feel cooler.</p>
