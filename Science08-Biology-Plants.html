        <center><h1>Photosynthesis</h1></center>
        <p>Photosynthesis is a process that plants use to make food. Think of it as a recipe:</p>
        <p>The ingredients are Carbon Dioxide and Water...and the end products are Glucose and Oxygen.</p>
        <p>But as with any recipe, you don't just wait for the Ingredients to become food! You supply energy by turning on the oven, giving the ingredients heat.</p>
        <p>The plant absorbs energy from the Sun, and uses it to make Glucose, the plant's food.</p>
        <p>CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O -> C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + O<sub>2</sub></p>
        <p>...and the balanced equation (see chemistry) is...</p>
        <p>6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O -> C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub></p>
        <p>There's just one problem, though. Glucose is soluble (dissolves) in water. It is a Sugar which is a carbohydrate.</p>
        <p>...And you can't store a cake which turns into mush quickly. So, the plant truns the glucose into starch.</p>
        <p>Starch is a chain of glucose molecules, and does not dissolve in water.</p>
        <p>Starch is stored in the chloroplast of leaf cells, wher photosynthesis takes place.</p><br>
        <center><h1>Mineral Salts: Fertilizers</h1></center>
        <p>Fertilizers contain mineral salts. These help the plant grow larger and stronger.</p>
        <p>There are to main kinds of fertilizer: Nitrates and Magnesium</p>
        <h2>Nitrates</h2>
        <p>Nitrates help the plant make proteins. These proteins help the plant make new cells.</p>
        <p>It is also needed to make chlorophyll. Plants short of Nitate will be stunted and yellow.</p>
        <h2>Magnesium</h2>
        <p>Like Nitrate, it is needed to make chlorophyll. Magnesium deficiency makes the plant grow yellow, lacking chlorophyll, which is the green pigment.</p>
        <center><h1>Plants and Water</h1></center>
        <p>When each cell of a plant contains a lot of water, they all press out on each other, keeping the plant structure firm.</p>
        <p>Water deficiency make the plant soft and floppy, making it collapse, which is called wilting.</p>
        <p>When water travels up the xylem, it also carries dissolved nutrients, such as mineral salts.</p>
        <p>Water then evaporates through the leaves, and when it does, it absorbs some of the plant's heat, cooling it down.</p>
        <p>Last but absolutely not least, it is a key ingredient in Photosynthesis.</p>
        <center><h1>Flower</h1></center>
        <p>NOTE: This is an activity. You either need a real flower, or an unlabelled picture of one.</p>
        <p>Flowers are brightly colored and scented to attract pollinators, which you will learn about in the next unit.</p>
        <p>On the outside, there are the brightly colored petals, and at the base of the flower, green petal-like sepals can be found.</p>
        <p>Around the center, there are many structures called Stamens, which have anthers connected to the flower by thin Filaments.</p>
        <p>The anthers on the tip of the stamens have grains of pollen, which contains the male gamete.</p>
        <p>The center of the flower is the Carpel, made of the Stigma, style, and ovary.</p>
        <p>The stigma and style (from top to bottom), are the tip of the carpel and its connection to the ovary (bulb shaped), respectively.</p>
        <p>Inside the ovary, the ovule is found, which contains the female gametes.</p>
        <p>Did you identify the parts of the flower? Search for flower structure online to see if you were right.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, <a href="http://biology4igcse.weebly.com/uploads/9/0/8/0/9080078/886383640_orig.jpg?380">Use this recommended picture.</a></p>
        <center><h1>Pollination</h1></center>
        <p>Remember how the Anthers have pollen grains, which contain the male gametes of a plant?</p>
        <p>As a refresher, when the male and female gamete meet, they form a seed, which we will explain in the next lesson(fertilization)</p>
        <p>But the problem is getting one plant's male gamete to the other plants female gamete.</p>
        <p>So, the plants secrete a sugary fluid, called nectar, to attract pollinators, which are insects and birds.</p>
        <p>When the pollinator comes to collect nectar, some pollen sticks onto them.</p>
        <p>When it goes to another plant, some pollen may rub off onto the other flower's stigma, where the story will be continued in the next lesson.</p>
        <p>However, some plants rely on the wind to blow their pollen to other plant, with a chance that it just might land on another plant's stigma.</p>
        <center><h1>Fertilization</h1></center>
        <p>After pollen falls on the stigma, it grows a tube through the style, into the ovary, and into the ovule.</p>
        <p>The male gamete goes down the tube, and then fuses with the female gamete in the ovule, forming a zygote.(meiosis)</p>
        <p>The zygote cell divides many times(mitosis), becoming a group of cells called the embryo.</p>
        <p>The ovule grows into a seed around the embryo. NOTE: The following is an activity, required a well soaked bean or lima bean seed.</p>
        <p>There is a Testa, an outer covering, and the Micropyle, a tiny hole from which the tube from the pollen grain had first entered.</p>
        <p>The bulk of the seed are the two cotyledons found from peeling the testa. It is the food stores for when the embryo first germinates.</p>
        <p>Pull these apart, and you will find the small embryo plant, which formed from the zygote after fertilization.</p>
        <center><h1>Fruits</h1></center>
        <p>While the ovule is busy becoming a seed, the overy becomes a fruit.</p>
        <p>Fruits help in seed dispersal, which disperses the seed so that it germinates far from the parent plant.</p>
        <p>If the seed germinates nearby, it will have to compete for resources with the parent plant, lowering its chance of survival.</p>
        <p>There are three types of seed dispersal:</p>
        <p>Parachute shaped fruits like dandelions, carry their seeds on the wind.</p>
        <p>Hooked or spiky fruits latch on to unknowing animals, which carry away the seeds.</p>
        <p>Fleshy fruits like apples and mangos, attract birds, which eat the fruits and carry the seeds on accident.</p>
