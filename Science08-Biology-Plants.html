        <center><h1>Photosynthesis</h1></center>
        <p>Photosynthesis is a process that plants use to make food. Think of it as a recipe:</p>
        <p>The ingredients are Carbon Dioxide and Water...and the end products are Glucose and Oxygen.</p>
        <p>But as with any recipe, you don't just wait for the Ingredients to become food! You supply energy by turning on the oven, giving the ingredients heat.</p>
        <p>The plant absorbs energy from the Sun, and uses it to make Glucose, the plant's food.</p>
        <p>CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O -> C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + O<sub>2</sub></p>
        <p>...and the balanced equation (see chemistry) is...</p>
        <p>6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O -> C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub></p>
        <p>There's just one problem, though. Glucose is soluble (dissolves) in water. It is a Sugar which is a carbohydrate.</p>
        <p>...And you can't store a cake which turns into mush quickly. So, the plant truns the glucose into starch.</p>
        <p>Starch is a chain of glucose molecules, and does not dissolve in water.</p>
        <p>Starch is stored in the chloroplast of leaf cells, wher photosynthesis takes place.</p><br>
        <center><h1>Mineral Salts: Fertilizers</h1></center>
        <p>Fertilizers contain mineral salts. These help the plant grow larger and stronger.</p>
        <p>There are to main kinds of fertilizer: Nitrates and Magnesium</p>
        <h2>Nitrates</h2>
        <p>Nitrates help the plant make proteins. These proteins help the plant make new cells.</p>
        <p>It is also needed to make chlorophyll. Plants short of Nitate will be stunted and yellow.</p>
        <h2>Magnesium</h2>
        <p>Like Nitrate, it is needed to make chlorophyll. Magnesium deficiency makes the plant grow yellow, lacking chlorophyll, which is the green pigment.</p>
        <center><h1>Plants and Water</h1></center>
        <p>When each cell of a plant contains a lot of water, they all press out on each other, keeping the plant structure firm.</p>
        <p>Water deficiency make the plant soft and floppy, making it collapse, which is called wilting.</p>
        <p>When water travels up the xylem, it also carries dissolved nutrients, such as mineral salts.</p>
