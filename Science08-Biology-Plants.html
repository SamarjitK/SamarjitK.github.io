    <center><h1>Photosynthesis</h1></center>
    <p>Photosynthesis is a process that plants use to make food. Think of it as a recipe:</p>
    <p>The ingredients are Carbon Dioxide and Water...and the end products are Glucose and Oxygen.</p>
    <p>But as with any recipe, you don't just wait for the Ingredients to become food! You supply energy by turning on the oven, giving the ingredients heat.</p>
    <p>The plant absorbs energy from the Sun, and uses it to make Glucose, the plant's food.</p>
    <p>CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O -> C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + O<sub>2</sub></p>
    <p>...and the balanced equation (see chemistry) is...</p>
    <p>6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O -> C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub></p>
    <p>There's just one problem, though. Glucose is soluble (dissolves) in water. It is a Sugar which is a carbohydrate.</p>
    <p>...And you can't store a cake which turns into mush quickly. So, the plant truns the glucose into starch.</p>
    <p>Starch is a chain of glucose molecules, and does not dissolve in water.</p>
