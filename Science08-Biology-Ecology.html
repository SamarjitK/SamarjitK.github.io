        <center><h1>Plant and Animal Adaptations</h1></center>
        <p>Over millions of years, plants have adapted well to their environments.</p>
        <p>For example, Spruce Trees in the Arctic have wax covered leaves, so that they don't lose too much water.</p>
        <p>Rainforest habitat Strangler Figs live in forest where there is thick competition for light, which becomes available mostly only for tall trees.</p>
        <p>So, the Strangler Fig's seed germinates high up in a tree where it can get sunlight, and slowly coils around the tree, until it can support itself.</p>
        <p>Annoying pests known as weeds are annual plants, so they finish their life cycle in less than a year and produce many seeds, making it hard for people to kill them.</p>
        <p>Animals have also developed adaptations:</p>
        <p>The desert's Arabian Oryx can survive on little water, and feed during the cooler nights, with large hooves so they don't sink into the sand.</p>
        <p>The Sealions streamlined body reduces friction with the water, as well as breathe under water for more than an hour.</p>
        <p>Earthworms have tiny bristles, making it hard for birds to pull them out of their burrows. These are just a few natural adaptations listed above.</p>
        <center><h1>What Ecologists Do</h1></center>
        <p>Ecologists study organims in their natural habitat.</p>
        <p>One example of an experiment is counting the number of fishes in lakes versus oceans.</p>
        <p>Instead of counting all the fish in the ocean, ecologists take a sample area, or sample random parts of it.</p>
        <p>These are sampling techniques. Some ecologists use a tool called a quadrat. It is a net of small squares, making it easier to count inside each square.</p>
        <center><h1>The Food Web</h1></center>
        <p>A food chain is the representation of the transfer of energy between organisms. For example:</p>
        <p>Nettle -> Aphid -> Blue Tit</p>
        <p>Nettles are the producers, which originally derived their energy from the sun.</p>
        <p>The Aphids are the primary consumers, or Herbivores, which eat the producers</p>
        <p>The Blue Tit is the secondary consumer, or carnivore, as it eats herbivores.</p>
        <p>A food web is the combination of interconnected food chains.
        <center><h1>Decomposer</h1></center>
        <p>When an organism dies, sometimes no organisms eat it...</p>
        <p>... Except decomposers, like Earthworms, Fungi, and Micro-organisms including bacteria.</p>
        <p>They release enzymes that break down the orgainsm into simpler molecules, releasing energy, and absorbing these molecules.</p>
        <p>For examply, fungus, grows Hyphae into the organic matter, breaking it down to simple molecules which diffuse into the Hyphae.</p>
        <p>These decomposers are eaten, or their nutrients are used by plants, returning the energy to the food chain.</p>
        <center><h1>Populations</h1></center>
        <p>Rise in birth rate and decrease in death rate increases the population, and the opposite decreases the population.</p>
        <p>There are three main factors that decrease population: Food Supply, Predators, and Disease.</p>
        <p>If the food that a species eats is in low supply, the species' population will decrease.</p>
        <p>If the predators of the species increase in population, the prey's population will subsequently decrease as death rate increases.</p>
        <p>If there is an outbreak of disease, an organism is likey to die, therefore decreasing the population.</p>
        <p>Human population, on the other hand, is increasing, and is predicted to be 10 billion by 2050, a drastic increase from 7 billion in back in 2012.</p>
        <center><h1>Fertilizer Pollution In Water</h1></center>
        <p>When a farmer accidentally adds fertilizer to the lake, the water plants and algae grow faster, known as an algal bloom.</p>
        <p>This blocks light to the plants underneath the surface, of which most die. The dead plants provide more food for the decomposer bacteria.</p>
        <p>The bacterial population increases. Baacteria respires, using up most of the oxygen in the water.</p>
        <p>Lack of oxygen kills most of the animals, including fishes, except a few animals adapted to less oxygen.</p>
        <p>Pollution, especially pollution caused by fertilizer and algal blooms, shoud be taken vry seriously.</p>
        <center><h1>Habitat Destruction</h1></center>
        <p>We are the main cause for habitat destruction. We use the land for crops, buildings, and roads. We are responsible for deforestation and mining also.</p>
        <p>People drain wetlands for irrgation, Cut down rainforests, endangering its animals.</p>
        <p>The carbon dioxide that we eject from factories dissolves in water, forming an acid, which destroys coral reefs.</p>
        <p>As you will see in the next lesson, motions have been taken to reduce our footprint on nature.</p>
        <center><h1>Environmental Protection</h1></center>
        <p>Many countries have pledged, in different ways, to reduce pollution and habitat destruction.</p>
        <p>161 countries have signed up to the Ramsar convention, which helps progress in saving the world's wetlands.</p>
        <p>Since 2000, treaaties to reduce use of CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) have led to a decrease in use, and the ozone level might recover completely.</p>
        <p>Though it is difficult, many nations are trying to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, as it causes global warming.</p>
        <p>As we continue to sign treaties to save the earth, we have proven that the pen is indeed mightier than the sword.</p>
