        <center><h1>Atomic Structure</h1></center>
        <p>In greek atom means 'cannot be split' because it is so small. It has protons electrons and neutrons.</p>
        <p>The protons (positive charge) and neutrons(neutral) are tightly packed in the center called the nucleus.</p>
        <p>Electrons, which have almost no mass at all, rapidly orbit around the nucleus.</p>
        <p>Between the nucleus and electrons, there is a vast amount of empty space - a vacuum.</p>
        <p>A scientist, Ernest Rutherford, fired small particles at gold foil - and 99% of them went through, only 1 in 8000 bouncing back.</p>
        <p>This led him to believe that the gold atoms were mostly empty space, with most of the mass in the nucleus in the center.</p>
        <p>The proton and neutron both have a mass of 1 AMU (Atomic Mass Unit), while the electron's mass is negligible.</p>
        <p>The mass number is therefore the sum of only the number of protons and neutrons.</p>
        <p>The atomic number is the number of protons in an element. Proton has positive charge, electron negative.</p>
        <p>The atom has no charge, as the number of protons and electrons is equal.</p>
        <center><h1>Electronic Structure</h1></center>
        <p>Electrons orbit the nucleus in shells or orbits.</p>
        <p>In the first orbit, there is room for two electrons, in the second shell, 8 electrons, in the third, 8, and so on.</p>
        <p>For example, Pottasium's (19 electrons) electron structure is 2,8,8,1.</p>
        <center><h1>Alkali Metals</h1></center>
        <p>Group 1 is the Alkali metals, so called because they form an alkali when they react with water.</p>
        <p>Down the group: Lithium (Li), Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), Rubidium (Rb), Caesium (Cs), and Francium (Fr).</p>
        <p>Their melting and boiling points decrease as you go down the group.</p>
        <p>They react more vigorously as you go down. While the first the metals reacting with water are safe, the reaction of Rubidium or Caesium is very explosive</p>
        <p>Francium, which is radioactive and has a half-life of only 22 minutes,put in water, is untested, as it would cause a Tsunami and destroy parts of the earth.</p>
        <center><h1>Halogens</h1></center>
        <p>Halogens are group 7, meaning salt-producing, as in reaction with metal, they form salt.</p>
        <p>Fluorine (F), Chlorine (Cl), Bromine (Br), Iodine (I), and Astatine (At). As you go down the group:</p>
        <p>Their reactivity decreases, and melting and boiling points increase.</p>
        <p>F and Cl are gases, Br liquid, I and At are solid.</p>
        <center><h1>Noble Gases</h1></center>
        <p>They are all gases, and are inert, meaning that they are unreactive and don't form compounds.</p>
        <p>Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn).</p>
